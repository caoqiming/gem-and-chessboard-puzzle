> I once came across such a puzzle and attempted to find the answer myself without looking at the solution. However, I couldn't solve it at that time and eventually forgot about it. Recently, while studying memory error correction algorithms, I was inspired and found a solution. Unfortunately, the original source of this puzzle is nowhere to be found now.

The puzzle can be described roughly as follows:
There is an 8x8 black and white chessboard with a hidden compartment beneath each square that can hold a gem. Two players participate in this puzzle.

1. Player B is blindfolded, and Player A can observe.
2. First, the puzzle setter places a gem in one of the hidden compartments on the chessboard in front of Player A. The chessboard is then filled with 64 pieces (each piece being either black or white entirely at random).
3. Player A cannot communicate with Player B but can flip exactly one piece on the board. (Each piece has a black and white side, and Player A is allowed to flip only one piece.)
4. Player B is then allowed to observe the chessboard and must guess the location of the gem.

These are the game rules. Before the game begins, the two players are allowed to discuss their strategy. How can they design a strategy so that Player B can successfully guess the location of the gem?
